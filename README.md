  "timestamp": "ISO-8601-timestamp",
  "data": {
    "TableName1": [/* remaining user data */],
    "TableName2": [/* remaining user data */]
  },
  "deletedRowCounts": {
    "TableName1": 5,
    "TableName2": 2
  },
  "parsingErrors": {
    "sheetsNotFound": ["Sheet1", "Sheet2"],
    "tablesNotParsed": [
      {
        "sheetName": "Sheet3",
        "reason": "Could not find expected header row",
        "expectedColumns": ["Column1", "Column2"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "totalTables": 2,
    "totalRemainingRows": 150,
    "totalDeletedRows": 7,
    "totalSheetsNotFound": 2,
    "totalTablesNotParsed": 1
  }
}
```

## Application Flow

1. **Consent Page**: Users review and agree to data donation terms
2. **Upload Page**: Users upload their PlayStation data file (.xlsx)
   - **File Validation**: Automatic detection of incorrect or corrupted files
   - **Warning System**: Users are alerted if the file lacks expected PlayStation data
   - **User Choice**: Option to try again or proceed anyway
3. **Filter Page**: Users review data tables and can delete specific rows
4. **Donation Process**: When "Yes, donate" is clicked:
   - All remaining data is collected
   - Deleted row counts are tracked
   - JSON package is created and downloaded
   - User is redirected to thank you page
5. **Thank You Page**: Confirmation with submission ID

## Technical Stack

### Key Components
- `FilterPage.js`: Main data review interface with donation functionality
- `UploadPage.js`: File upload and processing
- `playstationParser.js`: Excel file parsing logic
- `ConsentPage.js`: User consent and terms
- `ThankYouPage.js`: Donation confirmation

## Data Privacy & Security

### Privacy Features
- **Local Processing**: All data processing happens locally in the browser
- **User Control**: Users can delete specific rows before donation
- **Transparent Export**: Clear visibility into what data is being donated
- **Clean Data**: Internal application fields are automatically removed

### Supported Data Categories
- Account Device information
- Gameplay Online sessions
- Friend count data
- PS Stars campaigns and collectibles
- Transaction details
- Subscription information
- PS VR usage data

### File Validation & Failsafe System
The application includes an intelligent failsafe system that automatically detects potentially incorrect or corrupted PlayStation data files:

#### Detection Criteria
- **No Data Found**: Triggers warning when no PlayStation data sheets contain any actual data
- **Empty File Detection**: Identifies files that may be corrupted, incomplete, or not PlayStation exports
- **Data Validation**: Ensures at least one sheet of interest has recognizable PlayStation data

#### User Experience
When a problematic file is detected, users see:
- **Clear Warning Message**: Explanation of the potential issue
- **Detailed Information**: List of missing or unparseable sheets
- **Action Options**: 
  - "Try Again" - Upload a different file
  - "Proceed Anyway" - Continue with available data
- **Guidance**: Recommendation to contact researchers if needed

#### Expected PlayStation Data Sheets
The system expects to find these sheets in a valid PlayStation data export:
- Account Device
- Gameplay Online
- No of Friends
- PS Now
- Ps Stars Campaigns
- Ps Stars Collectibles
- Ps Stars Enrollments
- Ps Stars Points History
- PS VR
- Subscription
- Transaction Detail
